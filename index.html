	<h2>About</h2>
	
	<p>Mijndert works at Rhinofly. When he’s not working his ass off, he’s probably listening to music, having a beer with friends or geeking out on one of his projects. He’d worked on some pretty cool stuff like <a href="http://nextbestband.nl">Next Best Band</a> and he also helped out <a href="http://okgo.nl/">OK GO</a> launch <a href="http://foodzy.com">Foodzy</a>. His biggest dream is to move to London one day.</p>

	<p>Other than being a great guy he’s also more than willing to help out startups achieve their goals by lending them his expertise. He’s pretty good with high performance IT infrastructure to make any web app go <i>woosh</i>.</p>

			<p>“I hired Mijndert to convert an old, image-map based website into a working Wordpress website. He created a custom Wordpress theme and I found it to be coded very well (lightweight!). He also went the extra mile when I found a few odds and ends I failed to mention in the conversion process and fixed those as well. Mijndert is the real deal! I will absolutely hire him again.”</p>

			<p>"Mijndert is one of the best all-round internet/server dudes I know. Whatever you ask him, exotic or complex, he knows how to get it done. Mijndert responds immediately to emails, making my life as a web developer much easier. A few days ago I asked him to install a feature on a server we're working on. He did it right away, which meant that I could continue my work uninterrupted."</p>
