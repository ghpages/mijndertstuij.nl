title: "My current favorite podcasts"
---

Podcasts are a great way to stay up-to-date on subjects you would like to know more about. They are bite-sized pieces of information that come in either a audio or a video format. Most of them are published on a weekly basis. You can find a lot of them in the iTunes Podcast Directory. I decided it's time to share the podcasts I listen to the most.

"Build & Analyze":http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze is a weekly show on iOS and mobile web development.
"Enough":http://minimalmac.com/enough is a podcast on minimalism and focusses on Apple devices and services.
"Founders Talk":http://5by5.tv/founderstalk is an interview podcast profiling the founders of startups.
"The Talk Show":http://5by5.tv/talkshow is a general podcast on just about anything geeks care about.

As you can see, 75% of my favorite shows are from the "5by5":http://5by5.tv/ network. 5by5 offers some of the best in-depth discussions on topics I personally care about. Dan Benjamin, John Siracusa and John Gruber are basically my heroes. Then there's the Enough podcast which really augments the excellent "Minimal Mac":http://minimalmac.com/ website.
