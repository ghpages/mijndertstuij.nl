title: "Use Lighttpd as a transparant proxy"
---

Using the proxy module in "Lighttpd":http://lighttpd.net you can get a transparant, super light-weight web server in front of your application server. I've been using it to proxy traffic to the built-in web server of the "Play framework":http://playframework.org for SSL termination.

First you will need to enable the proxy module in lighttpd.conf. 

{% highlight bash %}
server.modules = ( "mod_proxy" )
{% endhighlight %}

After that you can enable proxying by including the following inside your vhost declaration. 

{% highlight bash %}
proxy.balance = "round-robin" proxy.server = ( "/" =>
( ( "host" => "127.0.0.1", "port" => 8080 ) ) )
{% endhighlight %}

You can add as many backend servers as you need.
