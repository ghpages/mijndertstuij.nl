title: "Monitor Amazon Web Services RDS instances with Nagios"
---

RDS or "Relational Database Service":http://aws.amazon.com/rds/ allows you to run on-demand servers with full access to MySQL and Oracle databases. When you're using Nagios it's nice to have an alert for when your RDS instance becomes unresponsive. Nagios Exchange provides a "small Perl script":http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Databases/MySQL/check_mysqld/details that can do exactly that.

You need to download and copy this Perl script to /usr/local/nagios/libexec, or wherever your "Nagios":http://www.nagios.org/ install is on your system.

Now we can define a service command.

{% highlight bash %}
define command{
command_name check_mysqld
command_line /usr/bin/perl $USER1$/check_mysqld.pl -H your-rds-hostname -u $ARG1$ -p $ARG2$
}
{% endhighlight %}

And we need a service check within the server config.

{% highlight bash %}
define service
use generic-service
host your-host
service_description MySQLd check
check_command check_mysqld!username!password
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now all we need to do is restart the Nagios daemon and wait for the new command to initialize. The service check will try to do a 'mysql status' command every once in a while.
