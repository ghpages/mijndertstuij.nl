title: "Hosting your Jekyll website on GitHub pages"
---

GitHub has a lot of great but rather hidden features. Features not everyone is aware of and maybe don't get used as often. Features like "Gists":https://gist.github.com/, "The Octodex":http://octodex.github.com/ and most notably "GitHub Pages":http://pages.github.com/.

With GitHub Pages it's super easy to host your "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll based, or otherwise static, website on GitHub so you don't need to setup a server yourself. Here's how to do it.

First we need to create a branch called gh-pages. One way to do it is with the GitHub for Mac application which you can download for free. Or use your own favourite way of branching Git repositories.

From now on it's easy to just work on your website in the gh-pages branch, or do some changes in master and merge when you're done.

Now you need to add a file called 'CNAME' to your website's root directory. The CNAME file should include the address of your website, so mine would include 'mijndertstuij.nl'. Commit the CNAME file and change your A-record in DNS settings to 204.232.175.78.

When your GitHub page is generated you will get a notification. It may also take up to 24 hours for your DNS change to be fully propagated. If you want to check out my Jekyll project head over to my "GitHub page":https://github.com/mijndert. And as always, if you see room for improvement you can fork the entire repository and send me a pull request.
