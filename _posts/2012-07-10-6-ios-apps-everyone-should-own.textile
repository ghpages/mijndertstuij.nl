h3. Instacast

Price: &euro; 1,59
Link: "iTunes store":http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/instacast/id420368235?mt=8

A while back Apple released it's podcast app, but Instacast still reigns as the best podcast experience on iOS. Instacast allows you to download or stream your favourite podcasts over 3G. Missing is the ability to import your current iTunes podcast subscriptions into Instacast but you can still find all of the podcasts you would find in the iTunes store.

h3. Tweetbot

Price: &euro; 2,39
Link: "iTunes store":http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/tweetbot-twitter-client-personality/id428851691?mt=8

There's a lot of Twitter clients to download and try and sometimes you encounter a great one. But not as great as Tweetbot. Tweetbot is the best Twitter client on both iPad and iPhone. Tweetbot has the best user experience of just about any iOS app. It can even sync your DM and timeline status across devices.

h3. Instapaper

Price: &euro; 2,99
Link: "iTunes store":http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8

Instapaper blows Pocket (formerly Read it Later) out of the water when it comes to fonts, options and the overall user experience. It took me a while to figure that out but once I made the switch I wondered why I didn't do it sooner. Marco is an awesome developer and I'm glad to support him by buying his app and a yearly subscription.

h3. Verbs

Price: &euro; 0,79
Link: "iTunes store":http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/verbs-im/id392501688?mt=8

Verbs is a simple IM client that runs on both iPad and iPhone. It can connect to Facebook Chat, AIM, Google Talk and others. There's an in-app purchase of around &euro; 4,- which might sound like a lot but it gives you the ability to stay connected for days while the app is in the background.

h3. Prompt

Price: &euro; 5,99
Link: "iTunes store":http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/prompt/id421507115?mt=8

Prompt is an app by Panic, one of my favourite Mac/iOS shops, that allows you to setup an SSH connection on your iOS device. It can even import your SSH keys from the clipboard or via iTunes file transfer. 

h3. Paper

Price: Free
Link: "iTunes store":http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8

Paper is an app made by the same guys who worked on the Microsoft Courier. Paper looks and feels like a really polished app. There's a great set of brushes available with an in-app purchases. I recommend you use Paper with a Wacom Bamboo Styles for the iPad.
